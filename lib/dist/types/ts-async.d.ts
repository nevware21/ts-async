/**
 * Calls the provided `callbackFn` function once for each element in an array (or ArratLike) instance in ascending index order. It is not invoked
 * for index properties that have been deleted or are uninitialized. And unlike the ES6 forEach() this supports async functions and you CAN stop
 * or break the iteration  by returning -1 from the `callbackFn` function.
 *
 * The range (number of elements) processed by arrForEach() is set before the first call to the `callbackFn`. Any elements added beyond the range
 * or elements which as assigned to indexes already processed will not be visited by the `callbackFn`.
 *
 * The `callbackFn` may execute `synchronously` or `asynchronously` and if the `callbackFn` returns a `Promise` then the next iteration will not be
 * called until the promise is resolved. If the `callbackFn` returns a `Promise` that is rejected then the iteration will stop and the promise
 * returned by arrForEachAsync will be rejected with the same error.
 * @since 0.5.0
 * @group Loop
 * @group Array
 * @group ArrayLike
 * @typeParam T - Identifies the element type of the array
 * @param theArray - The array or array like object of elements to be searched.
 * @param callbackFn - A `asynchronous` or `synchronous` function that accepts up to three arguments. arrForEach calls the callbackfn function one
 * time for each element in the array.
 * @param thisArg - An object to which the this keyword can refer in the callbackfn function. If thisArg is omitted, null or undefined
 * the array will be used as the this value.
 * @remarks
 * arrForEachAsync supports either a `synchronous` or `asynchronous` (returns a `Promise`) callback function. If the callback function returns
 * a `Promise` then the next iteration will not be called until the promise is resolved. If the callback function returns a `Promise` that is
 * rejected then the iteration will stop and the promise returned by arrForEachAsync will be rejected with the same error.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4', 'item5', 'item6', 'item7', 'item8', 'item9', 'item10'];
 * const copyItems = [];
 *
 * arrForEachASync(items, (value, index) => {
 *   copyItems.push(value);
 *   if (index === 5) {
 *     return -1; // Stop the iteration
 *   }
 * });
 * console.log(copyItems); // ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4', item5']
 *
 * // Also supports input as an array like object
 * const items = { length: 3, 0: 'item1', 1: 'item2', 2: 'item3' };
 *
 * // Asynchronous examples using await
 * const items = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4', 'item5', 'item6', 'item7', 'item8', 'item9', 'item10'];
 * const copyItems = [];
 *
 * await arrForEachASync(items, (value, index) => { // Note: DO NOT use async here unless you use await within the function
 *   if (index < 5) {
 *     // Logs each iteration index
 *     // Logs each value
 *     console.log(value);
 *     // Returning a promise will cause `arrForEachAsync` to return a promise to the caller
 *     // and wait for the promise to resolve before calling the callback function again.
 *     return createTimeoutPromise(10, true);
 *   }
 *
 *   return -1; // Stop the iteration

 * This interface definition, closely mirrors the typescript / javascript PromiseLike<T> and Promise<T> definitions as well as providing
 * simular functions as that provided by jQuery deferred objects.
 *
 * The returned Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers
 * with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous
 * methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point
 * in the future.
 *
 * A Promise is in one of these states:
 * <ul>
 * <li> pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
 * <li> fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
 * <li> rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
 * </ul>
 *
 * A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the
 * associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called synchronously. If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected
 * when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called synchronously, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous
 * operation completing and its handlers being attached.
