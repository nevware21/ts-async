/**
 * Create a Promise object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
 * This interface definition, closely mirrors the typescript / javascript PromiseLike<T> and Promise<T> definitions as well as providing
 * simular functions as that provided by jQuery deferred objects.
 *
 * The returned Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers
 * with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous
 * methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point
 * in the future.
 *
 * A Promise is in one of these states:
 * <ul>
 * <li> pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
 * <li> fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
 * <li> rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
 * </ul>
 *
 * A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the
 * associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called synchronously. If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected
 * when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called synchronously, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous
 * operation completing and its handlers being attached.
 *
 * As the `then()` and `catch()` methods return promises, they can be chained.
 * @typeParam T - Identifies the expected return type from the promise
